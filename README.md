# Python_Assignments

## What included in these Python Exercises?

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library

Each exercise contains specific Python topic questions you need to practice and solve. These free exercises are nothing but Python assignments for the practice where you need to solve different programs and challenges.

## Note : 

Download Python from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.2/ and install in your system to execute the Python programs. You can read our Python Installation on Fedora Linux and Windows 7, if you are unfamiliar to Python installation.
You may accomplish the same task (solution of the exercises) in various ways, therefore the ways described here are not the only ways to do stuff. Rather, it would be great, if this helps you anyway to choose your own methods.
